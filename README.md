Configuration Management Assignment for Software Engineering II

## What is SCM?
SCM or System Configuration Management is a software engineering practice tha focuses on the configuring of software
systems and ensuring that software components are controlled, tracked, and stored. A critical aspect of software development
is SCM since it ensures any changes made to the software system are properly coordinated thus leading to being in a constant state
of stability. SCM involves a set of processes and tools that help management of the different components. This can include 
source code, documentation, and other assets.This allows for team work since changes can be tracked made with the system,
identifies when and why changes were made, ultimately managing the integration of these changes for the final product. 

## How does GitHub Help?
GitHub supports all aspects of SCM. GitHub is capable of version control systems since it can store a complete history of all changes.
This can be monitored from the GitHub website. Commit tracking that records any changes that are made and when. Messages along 
with the commit can be made after adding the file. These messages can be seen on the right side of the file along with the time stamp.
Branching enables parallel development without any conflicts since they have the capability to merge with one another. Pull requests 
can be enabled to review and approve any code changes before merging. Repositories are capable of recording any issues from other users
that can track bugs and tasks. With this naturally forums form within the issues as they can help aid others who may be facing similar/same 
issues. Github is capable of automated testing, builds and deployments such as CI/CD. Environments that allow for files to be staged
before pushes and packages may be stored and keep track of version software dependencies.
